`1` *Class Members*

>1. Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited by subclasses of that class.

>2. Only members of a class that are declared protected or public are inherited by subclasses declared in a package other than the one in which the class is declared.

>3. Constructors, static initializers, and instance initializers are not members and therefore are not inherited.
